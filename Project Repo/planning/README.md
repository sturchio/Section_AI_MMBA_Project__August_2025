# üìñ README.md ‚Äî Event Slammer Planning Docs

This document is one of several that make up the **Event Slammer** planning package. Since GitHub's '<> Code' editor doesn't show working check boxes in Preview, I've placed copies of the three task lists in ['Issues'](https://github.com/sturchio/Section_AI_MMBA_Project__August_2025/issues), too. When displayed in Issues, click boxes actually work. Enjoy!

## üß† Summary
Event Slammer helps creative teams ideate client-focused event concepts faster and more collaboratively. These documents support structured planning, MVP delivery, and developer onboarding.

## üìÅ Usage Notes
- This repo is a **living design system**. Diagrams and tasks are subject to updates.
- Task files use markdown checkboxes so they can be tracked manually or by an LLM under dev guidance.
- Diagrams use **Mermaid syntax** for easy preview in tools like GitHub or Obsidian.
